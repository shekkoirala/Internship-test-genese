1. iterated over all the fibonacci values below 4000000 
2. do a if value % 2 == 0: total += value. 
3. (The % is the remainder on division operator.)
4. if the remainder when dividing by 2 equals 0 then the number is even.
5. this way I calculate the even number and each time add the value of even to total.
6. if value of even is greater than 4e6, I break from the infinite loop.
